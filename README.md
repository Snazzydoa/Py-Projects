# Py-Projects

This is a project done with Jupyter Notebook, an open document format based on JSON.



# About

This project was carried out to visualize the datasets within the 'Automobile_price_data' spreadsheet.


# Presentations

Bar charts were used to visualize some selected datasets within the input spreadsheet. 

Make, Fuel type, Aspiration, Number of doors, Body style, Drive wheels, Engine location, Engine type, Number of cylinders and fuel system were all plotted against their value 

counts.

# What to Look out for

There is an extra Spreadsheet document with the filename 'GNSS Pricing'

I am currently gathering the necessary information from GNSS equipment manufacturers' website about at least one of their GNSS equipment models.

The end result of the project would compare the pricing alongside other parameters necessary for a prospective buyer to decide on which is more accurate and affordable.
