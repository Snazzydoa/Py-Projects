# Py-Projects

This is a project done with Jupyter Notebook which is an open document format based on JSON.



# About

This project was carried out to visualize the datasets within the 'Automobile_price_data' spreadsheet.


# Presentations
Bar charts were used to show the relationships between some selected datasets within the input spreadsheet.


# What to Look out for

There is an extra Spreadsheet document with the filename 'GNSS Pricing'

I am currently gathering the necessary information from GNSS equipment manufacturers' website about at least one of their models.

The endresult would compare the pricing alongside other parameters necessary for a prospective buyer to decide on which is more accurate and affordable.
